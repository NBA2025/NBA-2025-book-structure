## Synthesis

The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) proposes a threats classification scheme with a hierarchical structure for various pressures on biodiversity. The NBA 2018 adopted this approach with some minor language adaptations and the resulting pressure plots are used throughout the NBA 2018 reports. The species plots were based on a meta-analysis of species Red List assessments (which document pressures on each species) and the cross-realm plot was informed by the species meta-analysis and expert inputs.

## Ecological condition overview

Ecological condition is estimated using a range of different approaches across the realms, but essentially depends on the ability to spatially represent the various pressures exerted on biodiversity. Ecological condition in the terrestrial realm relies primarily on land cover change data; cumulative pressure mapping is used in the marine realm; and a multi-criteria ecological condition framework is used in the estuarine and inland aquatic realms. The different systems were aligned as far as possible in the NBA to allow for crossrealm comparisons and unified terminology.

The marine and terrestrial realms are similar in terms of their relatively high percentage of natural/near-natural ecosystem extent (Â± 80%). In these extensive realms, ecosystem modification tends to be focussed in pressure hotspots, usually linked to regional characteristics such as high productivity, accessibility and valuable natural resources; while large areas remain relatively unmodified or intact. For example, the Cape lowlands have extensive winter field crops while the mountainous areas of the Cape see far less intensive agriculture; all bay ecosystem types, the shelf edge and the KwaZulu-Natal Bight are subject to multiple pressures while many deep sea ecosystems
